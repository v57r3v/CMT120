Assessment   Description
For   this   coursework, you   are   asked   to:
1.    Implement a personal digital portfolio   in   the   form   of   a   dynamic   websit代 写CMT120 Fundamentals of ProgrammingJava
代做程序编程语言e,   which            showcases   your   competences, skills   and   expertise, e.g.   your   technical   skills, work produced   to   date, previous   work   experience, etc.   - the   choice   of   what   you   want   to    cover   it’s   up   to   you, but   make   sure   you   cover   a   reasonable   range   of   these.
2.    Record   a   short   3-mindemo   of   your   website.
3.   Write   a   report   to   evaluate   your   website’s   quality,   usability   and   security.
1         Personal   Digital   Portfolio   as   Dynamic   Website
1.1         Website   Implementation
•   The website   is to be   implemented using any   appropriate   tools   and   methodologies,      covered   in   this   module, e.g.   JavaScript,   Python/Flask,   HTML, CSS, databases, etc.
•   The   majority   of   your   website   content   must   be   ’dynamic’,   i.e.   appropriate   data   and content are pulled from/pushed to   a database.
-    Examples   of   dynamic   content   include, but   are   not   limited   to:   interaction   with the   user   (e.g.   user   comments   or   rating),   user   accounts, automatically
generated web pages.
-   You   can   employ   any   type   of   database   system/service.
•    Use   of   external   libraries, extensions   and   APIs   is   allowed, e.g.   Flask-WTF,
Flask-Security,   Bootstrap.   However, the   ﬁnal   code   must   be   authored   by   you.   You are   reminded of the   need to comply with Cardiff   University’s Student   Guide to   Academic   Integrity.   If you   use external   resources, you   must provide complete   references, e.g.   as   in-line comments   in your code, and/or   in   README.md   ﬁle.               Evidence of   unfair practice will   be   penalised.
•    Use of the code you developed when working on the   lab   exercises   for   this   module   is   allowed.
•   Although   it’s   advisable   to   use   the   university   laptop, you   can   use   your   own
computer to   implement your website.   However, you must use School-based   systems   and   servers   for   hosting   ’dynamic’ parts   of   your   website,   e.g.   database   for content and   user accounts, deployment server.   The use   of   external services   for these elements   is not   allowed.
•      Complete code of your website   must be submitted   to   COMSC’s   GitLab   server   (https://git.cardiff.ac.uk/) and   shared   with   the   module   lecturers   - complete instructions on   how to do   it are given   in ’Submission   Instructions’ section   below.
1.2         Structure   and   Functionality   of   the   Website
You are free to choose   how to structure your website, and what   functionality   to implement,bearing in   mind that appropriate advanced functionality will attract   higher   marks - see ’Assessment Criteria’   section   below.
1.3            Deployment   of   Website
The expectation   is that   initially you will be   implementing and deploying your website   on      localhost.   Deployment of your website on a   localhost will allow for   a   mark   up   to   a   ’Pass’   for the website   implementation part.   To obtain a   higher   mark, your website   needs to   be      deployed on COMSC’s OpenShift server - see   ’Assessment   Criteria’   section.   The process   is   described   in   ’Flask   4:   Deployment   on   OpenShift’   lab   sheet   and   is demonstrated   in the practical session.   Make sure you state the   correct   URL   in your REAMDE.md submitted   in your git   repository on GitLab   and   in   your   report.    If this   is   missing or   incorrect,   it will be assumed that you   have not deployed   your website   on   OpenShift.
2         Video   Demo   of   the   Website
Record a short video demo of maximum 3   minutes,   which   demonstrates   the functionality you implemented on your website.If you   have successfully deployed your website   on OpenShift, you   should   clearly   demonstrate you are   running your website   using the   URL you submitted   in your      REAMDE.md   ﬁle.
More detailed   instructions will be provided in   the   contact   sessions.
3         Report   on   Website’s   Security, Quality   and   Usability
Write   a   report   of   800 words   (±   10%), in   which   you   critically   appraise   TWO   examples   from your website   implementation that demonstrate your appreciation of best   practice   in   security, quality   and   usability   (choose   any   two).
The front page of your   report   must   contain:
•   Your student   number
•    URL   of   your   website   on   OpenShift   (if   deployed)
Your   report   must also   include two appendices at the end   of your   report:
•   Appendix A:   list of   advanced functionality you   have implemented;
•   Appendix   B: screenshots   of   all   of   your   website’s   pages.
